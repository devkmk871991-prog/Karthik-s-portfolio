<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Karthik, a passionate full-stack developer who loves turning ideas
  into intuitive, functional digital experiences. I enjoy working across the
  entire development stack—from crafting clean, responsive interfaces to
  building powerful and efficient backend systems. For me, development isn’t
  just about writing code; it’s about creating solutions that feel seamless and
  purposeful.
</p>

<p>
  One of my strengths is problem-solving. I enjoy breaking down complex
  challenges, understanding how systems fit together, and finding smart ways to
  make things work better. Whether debugging tricky issues or designing scalable
  architectures, I bring patience, curiosity, and a logical approach to
  everything I build. Every project is an opportunity to learn, improve, and
  push my skills further.
</p>

<p>
  I’m constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and technologies to stay ahead
  in a fast-moving industry. My goal is not only to write good code but to
  create meaningful experiences—projects that are reliable, efficient, and
  enjoyable to use. If you’re looking for someone who’s dedicated, thoughtful,
  and genuinely excited about technology, you’re in the right place.
