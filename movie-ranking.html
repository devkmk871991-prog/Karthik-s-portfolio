<h1>The Best Movies According to Karthik</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>
  I think the Harry Potter movies do a fantastic job bringing the magical world
  to life,<br />
  but I feel some of the details from the books get lost in the adaptation
  process for the sake of pacing.
</p>

<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>
  I love how Money Heist keeps me constantly on edge with its clever twists,<br />
  although I sometimes feel the drama overshadows the heist planning.
</p>

<h3>Bison</h3>
<p>
  I appreciate how Bison delivers its action and emotion with intensity,<br />
  though I feel the pacing could have been tighter to keep me fully engaged
  throughout.
